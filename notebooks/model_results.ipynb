    "### Final Verdict\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for Balanced Summarization (Detail + Clarity): BART (M1)**  \n",
    "- Provides well-structured summaries with good readability and retention of key details.  \n",
    "- Slightly slower than T5 but offers the most comprehensive summary among the three.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for Speed & Efficiency: T5 (M2)**  \n",
    "- The fastest model, completing the task in 3.31 seconds.  \n",
    "- Uses moderate memory but sometimes sacrifices key details in the summary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for Extreme Compression & Minimal Memory Use: PEGASUS (M3)**  \n",
    "- Uses the least memory (0.0731 MB) but takes the longest time (12.83 sec).  \n",
    "- The summary is highly compressed, which may be useful for short snippets but risks omitting crucial information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "- If the goal is **accuracy and completeness**, **BART (M1)** is the best choice despite being slower.  \n",
    "- If **speed** is the priority, **T5 (M2)** performs best, though it may miss some nuances.  \n",
    "- If **memory efficiency** and extreme brevity are required, **PEGASUS (M3)** is effective but not ideal for in-depth summarization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For most **general-purpose summarization tasks**, where **clarity, completeness, and readability** matter, **BART (M1)** emerges as the best model in this study.\n"
